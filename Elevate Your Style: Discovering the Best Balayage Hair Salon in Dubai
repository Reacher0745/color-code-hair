Frequently Asked Questions

1. What is balayage, and why is it popular?
Balayage is a French hair coloring technique that involves hand-painting highlights onto the hair, creating a natural-looking, sun-kissed effect. It has gained popularity for several reasons:

Natural Look: Balayage creates soft, seamless transitions between colors, resulting in a more natural look compared to traditional foil highlights.

Low Maintenance: Because balayage highlights are hand-painted, they grow out more gracefully than traditional highlights, making them ideal for clients who prefer a low-maintenance hair color.

Versatility: Balayage can be customized to suit individual hair types, textures, and personal preferences, making it a versatile option for women of all ages and styles.

2. How long does a balayage appointment at Code Hair typically take?
The duration of a balayage appointment at Code Hair can vary depending on several factors, including the length and thickness of your hair, the desired color outcome, and any additional services requested. On average, a balayage appointment may take anywhere from two to four hours to complete.

3. Will balayage damage my hair?
When performed by skilled professionals using high-quality products, balayage is generally considered a low-risk hair coloring technique that minimizes damage to the hair. At Code Hair, our expert stylists take every precaution to ensure the health and integrity of your hair throughout the balayage process, using premium products and gentle techniques to achieve beautiful results.
